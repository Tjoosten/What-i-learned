It's never to late meet new people. 
====================================

Today i was going to Brussels (Belguim) on my one. To meet Emily and Tobias. 
In they train i was scared. And mulling about things? What they think about authism? Who are they? 
they are two awesome humans. We went out for a lunch and a chat. 
After that we go out for a walk. Like some architectural buildings in the city. 
 
 *we walk and walk*
 
And chat about everything we could. It was fun. 
But the hardest part of today was saying each other goodbye.
I hope we can hold contact with each other! 

And Emily i still want to help u with your fuse!

**THANKS** Guys for the great day i got in brussels. 
Now it is time to take my train. I dry my tear and move on with this joyfull memory in my mind!
